Portfolio Upload for Software Security



-Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

The client, Artemis Financial, is a consulting company that develops financial plans for its customers. Their goal is modernization of their practices. They currently have a RESTful API and wish to use the most current and effective software security to develop a financial app for customers to send and recieve data.
    
-What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

I believe categorizing issues and coming up with a mitigation plan I handeled the best. It is important to code securely to prevent customer and business data from being compromised. This adds value by increasing trust with customers the longer span of time between issues with security in your company, and can therefore increase customer growth and retention. 
    
-What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

I think the most challenging part was going over the dependency check for false positives and making sure I didn't omit anything by accident.
    
-How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

Layers of security were increased by running the dependency check and coming up with a mitigation plan to implement. I would use this dependency check in the future as well, as it was very comprehensive and linked to possible solutions.
    
-How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I updated the pom and dependency check to the latest versions, and there were no new vulnerabilities added.
    
-What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

The dependency check and how to add lines to the pom file will be useful in the future, as this was one of the first times I've had to interact with a pom file at all.
    
-Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I'd show them this report since it captures the idea that I know how to read a basic dependency check, come up with a mitigation plan, and document my findings in a professional manner.
